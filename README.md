# the_21_card_trick
Yes, I know this game. It is also known as the "21 Card Trick." The process is relatively simple but has a very effective psychological impact. Here are the steps for the game:

> Dealing the Cards:

You have a deck of 21 cards.
Deal them into three piles, placing one card in each pile sequentially until all cards are dealt. Each pile will have 7 cards.

> Choosing a Pile:

Show the piles to the player, and they choose the pile where their card is located.
Note which pile is chosen.

> Collecting the Piles:

Collect the three piles so that the pile with the chosen card is in the middle between the other two piles.

> Repetition:

Repeat the dealing of the three piles with the newly collected deck, showing them to the player again and having them choose the pile where their card is.
Collect the piles in the same manner, with the chosen pile in the middle.
This process is repeated a total of three times.

> Final Result:

After the third repetition, the card chosen by the player will be the 11th card in the deck.
The entire trick relies on the fact that with each dealing and collecting of the cards, the chosen card is shifted but maintains its specific relative position in the middle of the deck. After three repetitions, it will always end up being the 11th card.
